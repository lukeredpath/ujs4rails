  # Frameworks are the gems from Rails which you need PTK to load for your plugin.
  # The special :rails framework creates a fully-fledged Rails environment and requires
  # the environment.rb file.
  # Valid options are: :action_controller, :action_mailer, :active_record, :rails
  setup.frameworks = :rails, :action_controller # :active_record, :action_controller

  # Extra libraries of assertions and other common methods that provide more testing
  # utilities. To hand-pick which suites you want, uncomment the below 
  #setup.suites = :difference
  
  # If for some particular reason you do not want your plugin's init to be called
  # at the end of this block, uncomment the below:
  setup.init = false
